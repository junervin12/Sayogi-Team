# Sayogi Detector

This is an Android application that detects fruits and vegetables using a deep learning model. The model is based on transfer learning with YOLOv8 and has been trained on a custom dataset from Roboflow.

## Features

- Detects fruits and vegetables in real-time using the camera.
- Provides a freshness score to help users make informed decisions.
- Easy-to-use interface with clear instructions.

## Model Training

The model was trained using transfer learning with YOLOv8 on a custom dataset from Roboflow. Once trained, the custom YOLOv8 model was converted to TensorFlow Lite for deployment on Android.

## Download

The application can be downloaded from the following link:
